Contact Web App By using Flask
The project is about a Contact book which I have Developed by Flask and I have perform CRUD operations and for creatting database I have used sqlalchemy ORM .
Inside a project there is a HTML file which is used to show my all the contacts of database .
all the contact detail and there is some buttons -

1)add new contact- for storing the data in backend I make an method called show.Inside that method I am fetching the request which is coming from my frontend.

 2)Update contact- I used one method in backend called update.
 
 3)delete- I used delete for deleting the data by matching the id of available contact.
 
 4)View- I used view for showing full detail of contact like profile picture, DOB and name and phone.
